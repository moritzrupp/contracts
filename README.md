Contracts helps you to stay on track with all your contracts and subscriptions!

## Current status

contracts is currently under development and has just recently started. The idea is to have a simple and high-performance web application for managing all of your contracts and subscriptions. contracts is for self-hosting. It will not be available as a service for now. 

## Development

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
